WHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote 
The droghte 2 of Marche hath perced to the roote,	
And bathed every veyne in swich 3 licour,	
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;	
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth	       
Inspired hath in every holt 4 and heeth	
The tendre croppes, 5 and the yonge sonne	
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne, 	
And smale fowles maken melodye,	
That slepen al the night with open ye,	        
(So priketh hem nature in hir corages: 	
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,	
And palmers for to seken straunge strondes, 
To ferne halwes, 9 couthe 10 in sondry londes;	
And specially, from every shires ende	        
Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,	
The holy blisful martir for to seke,	
That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.
